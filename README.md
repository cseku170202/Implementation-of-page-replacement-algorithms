Page Replacement Algorithms

This integrated program includes 4 page replacement algorithms.

                                     1. FIFO
                                     2. LRU
                                     3. Optimal
                                     4. NRU
                                    
Run the program as follows:

Input:
No. of pages,
Page sequence,
No. of page frames.

Output
Graphical or visual representation of physical logical address for each replacement, 
No. of page faults
